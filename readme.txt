==Frequently Asked Questions==

= Why should I put an Infomous cloud on my WordPress site? =

Infomous clouds are a great way to engage your blog visitors. You can use Infomous to help them navigate the content on your own blog, or you can create an Infomous cloud to showcase related content from other sources, including news, social media and other blogs.

= Can I put more than one Infomous cloud on my WordPress site? =

You can put as many Infomous clouds on your site as you want. You can embed Infomous clouds in your posts or in your pages.

= What is the optimal size of an Infomous cloud? =

Infomous clouds have to be at least 300 x 300 in order to visualize content effectively. The larger the cloud is the easier it is for your users to explore your content. Clouds of the same width as your posts tend to perform well.

= How do I add an existing cloud from Infomous.com? =

Enter the node ID, which is the number that appears after http://infomous.com/node/ when you look at your cloud.

= I changed the color of the frame, how do I change the rest of the colors? =

To change the color of the words, you need to sign up for a "premium account" on Infomous.com.
